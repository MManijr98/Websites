			<h1>Michael Manigault Jr</h1>
			<p>I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science here at JCSU. I was born and raised in Queens, New York, <em>the best borough in New York City.</em> As far as my interests goes, I have <i> many </i> of them. I like watching wrestling, sports (especially baseball even people say it's <b>"boring"</b>), watching videos on YouTube (mainly wrestling, sports, comics, gaming, life hacks, or the daily YouTube drama), manga/anime, and comics. I also like memes. I'm a bit shy, partially due to the fact that I've been bullied for being both smart and a bit socially awkward. And speaking of being smart, I've been a straight A, Dean's List caliber student since kindergarten. Lastly, I'm a Boy Scout for <strong> 12 years </strong> and had achieved Eagle Scout, the highest rank in Boy Scouts, almost 2 years ago.
