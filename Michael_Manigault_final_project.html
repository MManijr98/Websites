			<h1> About Me </h1>
				<h2> My Family and Me </h2>
		         <p> My name is Michael Anthony Manigault Jr. I'm currently a senior here at Johnson C Smith University. I was born in Elmhurst in the borough of Queens, New York on July 4th, 1998. I had moved to Jamaica, Queens with my parents, Annette and Michael Sr, when I was a baby. And speaking of my parents, they were born and raised in New York; my mother was raised in Astoria and my father was raised in Harlem. Majority of the people in my father's side of the family were born and raised in the Carolinas.  </p>
